Hiding the root didn't work in my case, so this post (https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/9h866v/guide_on_how_to_hear_your_switch_audio_pc_audio/?utm_source=reddit) by u/No47 brought attention to the fact that you can simply use the Bluestacks Android emulator (https://www.bluestacks.com/) on your PC to use the NSO App. You just log in with your Google. The emulator will initially appear with an empty black screen (#1). Wait until the emulator is ready, with a colored screen background (#2). Even after the background appears, you should wait until the emulated phone has finished preparing its SD card: there will be a notice at the top of the phone screen while the card is being prepared.
